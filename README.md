# Vocabulary List
## Chapter 0: Introduction
1. **Programming:** is the act of constructing a program—a set of precise instructions telling a computer what to do.
1. **Programming Language:** is an artificially constructed language used to instruct computers.
1. **Best Practices:** a composed set of rules, prescribing the form programs should have.
1. **Vanilla JavaScript:** what comes with JS - "out of the box". We don't require to install or import anything to use functionalities that comes with VanillaJS.
1. **ECMAScript:** a standardized version of JS - interchangeable with name "JavaScript".
1. **NodeJS:** an environment for running JS outside of the browser.
1. **MongoDB/CouchDB:** two databases which use JS as the scripting and query languages.
## Chapter 1: Types, Values and Operators
1. **Code:** the text that makes up programs.
1. **Bits:** are any kind of two-valued things, usually described as zeros and ones.
1. **Value:** a chunk of information (in this case, in a JavaScript environment).
1. **Number:** a numeric type of value.
1. **Operators (e.g. +,-,*,/,%):** Putting an operator between two values will apply it to those values and produce a new value.
1. **Modulo:** an arithmetic operator which gives the remainder after dividing one number by another.
1. **Special Numbers (e.g. Infinity, -Infinity, NaN):**  are considered numbers but don’t behave like normal numbers.
1. **Strings:**  are used to represent text. They are written by enclosing their content in quotes(',",`).
1. **Escaping a character:** inside of a string, a character preceded by a backslash (\) is given special significance.
1. **Unicode Standard:** assigns a number to virtually every character you would ever need, including characters from Greek, Arabic, Japanese, Armenian, and so on. If we have a number for every character, a string can be described by a sequence of numbers.
1. **Concatenate:** glue two strings together.
1. **Template Literal:** a string encased in backticks, as opposed to single or double quotes.
1.**Binary Operator:** operators that use two values.
1. **Unary Operator:** operators that use one value.
1. **console.log:** a method for logging things to the console, and thus making them viewable.
1. **Boolean:** type of value, which has just two values,true and false, which are written as those words.
1. **Logical Operators (e.g. !, &&, ||):** operators which can be applied to boolean values themselves.
1. **Ternary Operator (conditional operator):** only such operator, first value picks second or third, based on its being true or false.
1. **Empty Values (e.g. null, undefined):** used to denote the absence of a meaningful value - used interchangeably for now.
1. **Type Coercion:** When an operator is applied to the “wrong” type of value, JavaScript will quietly convert that value to the type it needs, using a set of rules that often aren’t what you want or expect.
1. **Short Circuiting Evaluation:** only certain parts of a boolean expression (&&, ||) are evaulated. See examples for more details. (null || "agnes", "Agnes" || "user", false && "script")
## Chapter 2: Program Structure
1. **Expression:** A fragment of code that produces a value.
1. **Side Effects:** changes the internal state of the "machine" in a way that will affect the statements that come after it.
1. **Binding or Variable:** to catch and hold values. After a binding has been defined, its name can be used as an expression. The value of such an expression is the value the binding currently holds.
1. **Reserved Keywords:** words with a special meaning, such as let, are keywords, and they may not be used as binding names. There are also a number of words that are “reserved for use” in future versions of JavaScript, which also can’t be used as binding names.
1. **Environment:** The collection of bindings and their values that exist at a given time is called the environment.
1. **Function:** A function is a piece of program wrapped in a value.
1. **Invoking:** Executing a function is called invoking, calling, or applying it.
1. **"return":** When a function produces a value, it is said to return that value.
1. **Conditional Execution:**  is created with the if keyword in JavaScript; where the program takes the proper branch based on the situation at hand.
1. **Loop:** a form of control flow that repeats a section of code a certain number of times.
1. **"while":** a keyword - is followed by an expression in parentheses and then a statement, much like if. The loop keeps entering that statement as long as the expression produces a value that gives true when converted to Boolean.
1. **Indenting code:** consistent indentation is a good habit.
1. **Comment:** A comment is a piece of text that is part of a program but is completely ignored by the computer.
